# Contour Map Pathfinding and Searching Algorithm Visualizer

Visualize the most famous graph search/traversal algorithms on a grid with height values

Find the shortest path from a starting point to ending point with respect to distance and height

## What is it?
Contour Map pathfinding and searching algorithm visualizer that uses Depth First Search, Breadth First Search and Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path from start to finish, with respect to height and walls.

## Installation
This visualizer is inside a .jar file. Clone this repository and you will get the .jar file and the source code.

## Usage
- Click on 'Wall' button then select anywhere on the grid to create barriers for search
- Click on 'Root' button then select anywhere on the grid to create a starting point for the algorithm
- Click on 'Destination' button then select anywhere on the grid to create destinations for the algorithm
- Click on 'Eraser' button then select anywhere on the grid to remove any Walls, Roots, or Destinations
- Click on 'Raise Hill' button then select anywhere on the grid to create a hill on the grid
- Click on 'Lower Hill' button then select anywhere on the grid to create a valley on the grid
- Click on 'Raise Height' button then select anywhere on the grid to increase the height of selected square
- Click on 'Lower Height' button then select anywhere on the grid to decrease the height of selected square
- Click on 'Erase Height' button then select anywhere on the grid to reset the height of selected square to 1
- Choose Algorithm from dropdown
- Click 'Start' to begin search visualization
- Click 'Reset' to clear board

## Results
- Animation outlining how selected algorithm will work
- Grey squares showing the squares that the algorithm checked
- Yellow path showing the path the algorithm took to find destination
