# AlgorithmVisualizer

Visualization of Algorithms:
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

Instructions:
- Click on 'Wall' button then select anywhere on the grid to create barriers for search
- Click on 'Root' button then select anywhere on the grid to create a starting point for the algorithm
- Click on 'Destination' button then select anywhere on the grid to create destinations for the algorithm
- Choose Algorithm from dropdown
- Click 'Start' to begin search
- Click 'Reset' to clear board

Results:
- Animation outlining how selected algorithm will work
- Grey squares showing the squares that the algorithm checked
- Yellow path showing the path the algorithm took to find destination
