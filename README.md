# Grid Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

<h2> Visualize the most famous graph search/traversal algorithms on a grid</h2>
<h2> FInd the shortest path from a starting point to ending point</h2>

<h3>Visualization of Algorithms:</h3>
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
- Click on 'Wall' button then select anywhere on the grid to create barriers for search
- Click on 'Root' button then select anywhere on the grid to create a starting point for the algorithm
- Click on 'Destination' button then select anywhere on the grid to create destinations for the algorithm
- Choose Algorithm from dropdown
- Click 'Start' to begin search
- Click 'Reset' to clear board

<h3>Results:</h3>
- Animation outlining how selected algorithm will work
- Grey squares showing the squares that the algorithm checked
- Yellow path showing the path the algorithm took to find destination
